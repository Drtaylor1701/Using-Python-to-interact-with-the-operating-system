#grep - easily try out expressions and gain familiarity
#search to see if a string is present
#find text in /usr/share/dict/words, for example:
#grep thon
#case sensitive
#grep -i matches in a case-insentitive way
#reserved characters allow us to do more advanced matching:

#   . matches any character
#   ^ or $ match to the beginning or end of word:
#grep ^fruit would retrun all words beginning with fruit
#grep cat$ would retun words ending with cat
